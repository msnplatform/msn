                    Right now, this is a beta version of our service and we are working on it.
                    You have made your account in the start of the business, we are proud of you
                    and have many offers for you in the future to make you different from the people
                    creating account in that time. Because you have trusted us sooner...
                    </p>

                    We will inform you via email in the future to show you the new changes in the service.
